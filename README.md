The quest for answers to anything imaginable has fueled technological progress for centuries. As the complexity of these underlying physical systems grew, so did the need for intelligent automation to scale and advance. The emergence of AI has augmented our abilities to not just tackle these challenges, but also learn more about them.

Built around the idea of creating a generalist control agent for diverse experimental tasks, Quantized Utility Agents lay the groundwork for scalable AI systems capable of learning meaningful representations from raw sensory data and interacting with real-world scenarios, to test the acquired knowledge - harnessing machine intelligence to accelerate discovery.

This project aims at expanding the horizons of scientific understanding while building the foundation for self-driving experimental labs of the future.
